# Dhundo

It is a simple search engine in php designed by [Shivam srivastava](https://er1shivam.github.io).

This is basically my first project in PHP :smile:

# Use-how
Note:
I haven't added much database in the [Dhundo](http://dhundo.byethost7.com).
Some of the keywords you can use to search and get results are:

google,face,facebook,gmail,twit,twitter,online,learning,tutorial,udacity,edx,quora,youtube,video,
er1shivam,shivam,shiv etc

<b>But,yes</b> I have provided a <strong>Add </strong>button there so that anyone interested can add data regarding site
into the Database. cool n !! :smile:


# Play || Go to website

Since github doesn't provide hosting php sites, I am hosting  on some other servers.
You can go and check the search-engine [Dhundo](http://dhundo.byethost7.com/) running 24*7 [here](http://dhundo.byethost7.com/).
